#  Identification of senescent TREM2-expressing microglia in aging and Alzheimer’s disease model mouse brain
This repository includes analyses and processed data presented in Rachmian et al., 2024.

## Usage and documentation
Scripts are provided in the *scripts* directory. Data sets are provided in the *data* directory.</br>

To perform the analysis on the provided data sets, use the *TREM2_main_analysis.m* script.</br>
Before running the script, change the path in the *repository_path* variable to the path containing the corresponding repository on your computer.

## Compatibility
Was tested on Windows 11 using Matlab 2020b.</br>
Running the scripts on newer versions of Matlab may require downloading additional packages.
